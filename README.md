📝 This program is an HTML document with embedded JavaScript for creating and managing a todo list with three different practices. Let's break it down:

HTML Structure

DOCTYPE & HTML Tag: Specifies HTML5 and the document's English language.
Head Section: Metadata, links to "todo-list.css" and "todo-list.js," and title "📝 Todo List."
Body Section: Three practices with input fields, add buttons, and display areas.
CSS Styles

Styling for the body font and a grid layout for Practice 3.
JavaScript Logic

Arrays (listArray1, listArray2, listArray3) store todo items.
Functions (consoleList, add, renderList, addFull, renderFull, del) handle todo operations.
🚀 In summary, the program allows users to input and manage todos in three practices, each with distinct functionalities and styles.
